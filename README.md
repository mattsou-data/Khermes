This work was done in a group of 3, for the course 192.065 Cryptocurrencies (VU 4,0) 2024W taught at TU Wien in Austria.

The project was divided in 5 different tasks that built progressively on top of each other. The code present in this github passes the test cases for the all 5 task descriptions. 

It took approximately 120 hours of workload for each member of the group.
